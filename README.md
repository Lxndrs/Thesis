	- Characteristics of Orion Nebula 
	- Map of proplyds.

## Chapter 2: Bow Shock shape model.

	- Shocks
	- HII Regions.
	- Ionization fronts
	- Hypersonic approximation (CRW model)
	  - Derivation of equations 
	- Generic shape.
	  - Characteristic radii
	- Projection onto the plane of the sky
	- Quadrics of Revolution.

## Chapter 3: Application to Orion Proplyds.
	- Tracing Bow Shocks positions.
	- Measuring Empirical parameters: Rc and R0
	- Fit measurents into model.
	- Adjunt 2nd paper?

## Chapter 4: Discussion and conclusions

## Chapter 5: Future Work.

Calculate shape of wind-wind bowshocks

Python scripts written by Jorge to calculate the shape of an
axisymmetric bowshock due to the interaction between a proplyd flow
and a stellar wind.
